    my_approach_heading: My Approach to Therapy
    my_approach_text_html:
            My practice is based on a holistic blend of three therapeutic approaches:/ Psychodynamic, Person-Centered, and Cognitive-Behavioral therapy. Utilizing Psychodynamic Therapy, which involves exploring past experiences and unconscious processes, we uncover and understand deeply ingrained patterns and behaviors.
            <br><br>
            Complementing this approach, Person-Centered Therapy  is just as important since it focuses on the needs of each individual, ensuring that people's preferences, needs and values guide clinical decisions, and providing care that is respectful of and responsive to them. Complementing these is Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, providing practical strategies to manage and change negative thought patterns, empowering individuals to face life's challenges with resilience.
            <span class="text-primary">By weaving these therapies together, I offer a comprehensive journey tailored to the unique needs of each individual, guiding them towards a healthier, more fulfilled life.</span>

    section_header: Academic Background and Experience
    section_text:
      My educational journey in psychology began at the Metropolitan College of Piraeus, where I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Psychology. This foundational education laid the groundwork for my passion to delve deeper into the field.
      <br><br>
      Driven by a desire to provide the most comprehensive and effective support to my clients, I continued my academic journey and proudly graduated with a Master's Degree in Integrative Counseling and Psychotherapy. Integrative Psychotherapy holds a special place in my heart because it seamlessly combines three distinct therapeutic approaches into one powerful framework. This integrative approach allows me to offer tailored solutions for a wide range of challenges. From issues related to sexuality, anxiety, and depression to anger management, panic attacks, and difficulties in communication and expression, I am equipped to address the diverse needs of those seeking my guidance.
      <br><br>
      My actual experience as a psychologist started during my Master’s studies, in Roots Wellness Center, a bilingual center located in Athens where I underwent three years of comprehensive training. During my time there, i conducted individual therapy sessions to help individuals manage and overcome mental health concerns. On top of that, i attended regular supervision and professional development sessions to enhance my therapeutic skills.
      <br><br>
      After finishing my training and acquiring my Master’s Degree, i continued working as a licensed Psychologist - Psychotherapist and i’m still doing that to this day. Through my extensive experience in conducting therapeutic sessions, I have deepened my understanding of the complexities inherent in the therapeutic process. With each session, I have gained valuable insights into the diverse needs and concerns of each individual, allowing me to refine my approach and adapt my techniques accordingly. This hands-on experience has not only strengthened my ability to establish rapport and create a safe, supportive environment but has also equipped me with the tools to facilitate meaningful and transformative outcomes for those seeking help on their journey towards healing and self-discovery.
      <br><br>
      I am committed to fostering a therapeutic partnership that prioritizes your unique needs and goals, guiding you on a path towards healing and personal growth. Let's embark on this transformative journey together.
