  my_approach_heading: My Approach to Therapy
  my_approach_text_html:
          My practice is based on a holistic blend of three therapeutic approaches:/ Psychodynamic, Person-Centered, and Cognitive-Behavioral therapy. Utilizing Psychodynamic Therapy, which involves exploring past experiences and unconscious processes, we uncover and understand deeply ingrained patterns and behaviors.
          <br><br>
          Complementing this approach, Person-Centered Therapy  is just as important since it focuses on the needs of each individual, ensuring that people's preferences, needs and values guide clinical decisions, and providing care that is respectful of and responsive to them. Complementing these is Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, providing practical strategies to manage and change negative thought patterns, empowering individuals to face life's challenges with resilience.
          <span class="text-primary">By weaving these therapies together, I offer a comprehensive journey tailored to the unique needs of each individual, guiding them towards a healthier, more fulfilled life.</span>
