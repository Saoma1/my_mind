    Hello, I'm Eleni Lekka
  </h1>
  <p class="flex justify-center">
    I'm a dedicated bilingual mental health counselor with a deep commitment to helping individuals achieve emotional well-being. My journey into the world of psychology was driven by a deep sense of empathy and the belief that everyone deserves support and guidance on their path to personal growth and healing.
    My approach to therapy is rooted in my belief in the resilience of the human spirit and the potential for positive change. I understand that seeking help is a brave step, and I'm here to provide a warm, welcoming, and accepting space for you to explore your inner world.
